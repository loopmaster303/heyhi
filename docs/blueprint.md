## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) for a modern, sophisticated feel. It aligns with the dark mode and suggests intelligence.
- Background color: Dark gray (#28282B) to ensure a sleek dark mode experience with minimal distraction.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) as a contrasting hue, approximately 30 degrees to the left of the primary, for highlighting active elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look that complements the minimal chat interface.
- Use a set of minimalist icons to represent the four main tool modes: FLUX Kontext, Easy Image Loop, Code a Loop, Placeholder Loop.
- The layout should feature a centered chat area that maximizes readability. Keep left/right margins slim.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance the user experience when loading new messages or navigating between modes.
